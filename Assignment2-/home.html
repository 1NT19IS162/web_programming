  <h2 id="as">About Us</h2>
  <p> It is a discipline built upon a collection of methodological tools brought together to effect an integrated approach to problem-solving in engineering and management, with productivity improvement as its overall objective.

    Likewise, the ISE Club was formed by a group of passionate undergraduates in response to a call for the continuity of a close and tightly knit ISE community. The 1st ISE Club standing committee was put in place in the academic year 2002/2003, a year into the re-introduction of the new BEng (ISE) degree.
    
    Over the years, the various club committees, together with the ISE Department have made substantial efforts in promoting the ISE program within the university and externally, while striving to reinforce the cohesion among all the ISE community at the same time. The current (5th) standing committee was officially inducted in a simple inauguration ceremony on the 25th September 2006.
    
    The ISE Club organizes events on a regular basis for the benefit of the ISE community, such as the Family Day, career talks, industrial visits, personal improvement seminars and senior-junior interaction sessions. Additionally, the ISE Day is held annually in conjunction with the ISE Department, to welcome freshmen directly streamed into the BEng (ISE) program. As the year progresses, the Clubâ€™s focus on events will increasingly take on a practical-benefits approach, as per feedback from the community.
    
    Currently, the number of ISE undergraduates increases every cohort, as mandated by the Dean of the Engineering Faculty. As such, there will inevitably be new obstacles presented to the Club in its goal of bonding the ISE community together. Thus far, the 5th standing committee is reviewing its practices in a bid to streamline operations and ease transition from committee to committee.
    
    It is the committees wish that everybody in ISE will leave with a sense of belonging at the end of their studies. To that end, relationships and active participation form an important part in achieving so. Being in the committee is one way of doing that. Challenges and exciting developments are coming our way, and the path forward will surely be a satisfying one.
